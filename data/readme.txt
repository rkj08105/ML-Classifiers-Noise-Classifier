
The data_main.csv file contains the MOS score of different noisy speech samples 
obtained from the NOIZEUS speech corpus.

The noisy speech samples are first enhanced using the speech enhancement algorithms 
and then the enhanced speech samples are passed through the P.563 model to obtain
the speech quality (MOS score).
